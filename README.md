# BuildSrc

BuildSrc is a common build source for repositories.

## Purpose

The purpose of BuildSrc is to provide a centralized location for build-related scripts, configurations, and dependencies. It serves as a single source of truth for build-related tasks across multiple projects.

## Features

- Centralized build scripts: BuildSrc contains common build scripts that can be reused across different repositories.
- Shared configurations: BuildSrc includes shared configurations for tools like Gradle, Maven, or Bazel, ensuring consistency across projects.
- Dependency management: BuildSrc manages dependencies for build-related tasks, making it easier to update and maintain them.

## Usage

To use BuildSrc in your repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the BuildSrc repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-organization/buildsrc.git`
2. Copy the contents of the BuildSrc repository into your project's `buildSrc` directory.
3. Customize the build scripts and configurations according to your project's needs.
4. Update your project's build files (e.g., `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, or `BUILD.bazel`) to include the necessary dependencies and configurations from BuildSrc.
